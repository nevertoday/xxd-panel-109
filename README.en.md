## Sample works

This repository does not include unreviewed images or samples borrowed from another Panel. Independently generated and reviewed samples will be added here after the first release batch.

Some photographs already carry a strong identity and mood, but need a more deliberate visual reorganisation. **Panel 109** keeps the reality of the photograph and translates the other half through its own independent visual language, for art posters, independent publishing, exhibitions, social content, and design-only outputs.

It addresses the common problems of image and design talking past each other, over-decoration, weak whitespace, and inconsistent delivery across formats.

- One photograph becomes one isolated finished asset; photos are never combined.
- Top-bottom and left-right comparisons are strict 50:50 with no third band.
- Directory inputs are processed independently without cross-source subjects, copy, or results.
- `design-only` and wallpaper modes use the photo as reference only; the untransformed photo is not shown.

The Chinese file preserves this project’s original prompt and is the sole creative and aesthetic authority at runtime; the other versions are for reading, documentation, and sharing.

## Four output modes

- `top-bottom`：3:4 竖版原生结构，现实照片在上，Panel 109 设计在下，严格各占 50%。
- `left-right`：现实照片在左，设计在右，严格各占 50%，不会旋转成上下结构。
- `design-only`：整张画布只呈现本 Panel 的设计转译，照片只作为参考。
- `wallpaper-pack`：按设备分别生成完整画布，不把一张图机械裁成多台设备。

支持多比例、准确像素、文字自动生成／准确文字／无文字、图片目录批量处理，以及 `linked` 或 `independent` 壁纸关系。每次调用只创建一个新任务目录，最终交付为 PNG。

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-109.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-109" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-109
```

You can also install it directly with `npx skills`:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-109 --skill xxd-panel-109
```

The command fetches the repository from GitHub and installs the same-named Skill. For a user-level Codex installation, append `--global --agent codex --yes`; then restart the agent session and invoke:

```text
$xxd-panel-109
```
